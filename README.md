# Digital Cytogenesis
## Experimental Repository

This is an experimental repository to demonstrate the variable density / functionally graded material capabilities of FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) processes.
3D files will be created in the FOSS 3D editor Blender using the particle system, physics simulations and subsequently the Cell Fracture plugin that uses the particle positions to calculate a 3D voronoi diagram for initial testing.

### Warning
Due to a bug in the Cell Fracture plugin, the size of the objects is limited, else overlaps in individual cells will occur. However, fractured objects can later be scaled up to final dimensions without problems.
As a rule of thumb, any dimension in the lower double digit range should work.
